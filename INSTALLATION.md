Data Extractor provides an automated approach to running queries against an [IA Node](https://www.github.com/National-Digital-) for the purpose of data extraction.

## Building

### Java

To build this application via Java run the following

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

### Docker

To build this application via Docker run the following

```sh
docker build -t national-digital-twin/data-extractor -f Dockerfile .
```

## Running

### Prerequisites

We need the following components to be configured or running.

- [Identity Provider](#identity-providers)
- [Secure Agent](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/secure-agent-graph)
- [Data Dumping Destination](#data-dumping)

#### Identity Providers

The current supported Identity Providers are:
* Cognito
* Keycloak

A compose file is provided as part of [IA Node Access](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/ianode-access) which contains a local setup with test users
- [Keycloak](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/ianode-access/tree/pre/keyclock-local)
- [Cognito-Local](https://github.com/National-Digital-Twin/ianode-access/tree/pre/cognito-local)

#### Data Dumping

The current supported data dumping options are:

* exporting the data to an S3 bucket
  * you will need to set up an AWS account with access to write to an AWS S3 bucket
* printing the data to the logs

See the [configuration section](#configuration) for more details on the required properties and how to configure them.

### Java

```sh
DATA_EXTRACTOR_PROPERTIES=PATH/TO/YOUR/PROPERTIES.properties \
java -cp 'target/data-extractor-0.1.0.jar:target/lib/*' uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.extractor.DataExtractor
```

### Docker

```sh
docker run --rm \
-v PATH/TO/YOUR/PROPERTIES:/app/config \
-e DATA_EXTRACTOR_PROPERTIES=/app/config/PROPERTIES.properties \
--name data-extractor uk.gov.dbt.ndtp/data-extractor
```

## Configuration

The data extractor reads properties using [avaje-config](https://avaje.io/config/) via a file path defined in the environment variable `DATA_EXTRACTOR_PROPERTIES`.
The file can either be a `.properties` or `.yml` file however we will follow the `.properties` format for the rest of the documentation.
Examples of this configuration can be seen in [config directory](src/config), these examples are based on the setup of Cognito-Local from IA Node Access.
