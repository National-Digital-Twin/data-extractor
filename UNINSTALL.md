Uninstalling and removing the repository involves 3 parts:
- Delete installed JAR file
- Docker configuration and containers
- Delete repository clone

## Deleting installed JAR file

```sh
./mvnw dependency:purge-local-repository -DmanualInclude="uk.gov.dbt.ndtp.extractor"
```

## Deleting Docker containers

1. List all containers to find the container ID or name:

   ```sh
   docker ps -a
   ```
2. Stop the Docker container by ID or name if it is running:

   ```sh
   docker stop <container_id_or_name>
   ```
3. Delete the Docker container by ID or name:

   ```sh
   docker rm <container_id_or_name>
   ```

   You can also use the -f flag to forcefully remove a running Docker container:

   ```sh
   docker rm -f <container_id_or_name>
   ```
4. Confirm Docker has been deleted by listing all Docker containers:

   ```sh
   docker ps -a
   ```

## Deleting repository clone

Simply delete the cloned repository files from working location.
